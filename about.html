 <p style= "text-align: center" id = "h2TAG">Because of its decentralization, Blockstack provides a secure way to access private data. We used Blockstack as a proxy security measure -- the only way to access this page is through Blockstack authentication. As a result, the client’s data is secure as possible, and the results of the credit analysis machine cannot leave this site. 
	<br><br><img src= "1_6bOXOdSXtre9t7aMgTr-4A.png" class="center"><br>Blockstack also allows for the security of your information through a couple of other key features. 
	<br>One feature is the immutability of data within Blockchain. This means that when data enters the Blockchain, it cannot be changed or tampered with without alerting the rest of the nodes involved in the Blockchain. 
	<br><br>If one node is compromised by taking some wrong action, the rest of the nodes will recognize that and not take this action. In order for any action to be taken, most nodes involved in the Blockchain need to reach a consensus before anything happens. This creates a democratic system of taking action, rather than one central authority doing everything.
